### https://blockstream.info/
**Pros:**
- Clean UI, minimal design
- initially dark mode, color theme that's similar to code editors
- as open-source API https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora

**Cons:**
- Landing page doesn't show much stats
- For noobs, the lack of labelling and text makes it confusing

### https://bitcoinexplorer.org/
**Pros:**
- Dark mode available
- arranged like stock exchange page, with main stats as a top header
- Emphasis on showing mining pool

**Cons:**
- A bit busier, more of a personal preference

### https://www.blockchain.com/explorer

**Pros**
- Emphasis on charts and on-chain analytics
- Charts have simple interface, well organized

**Cons**
- Dark mode is too high contrast, better viewed in light mode
- Pop-up ads are annoying
- not clean or minimal, has cluttered feeling
- Better for on-chain analytics instead of block explorer

### https://mempool.space/
**Pros**
- Very miner focused, shows recent transactions stored in the mempool
- Cool visualizations of transactions with dynamic block map
- Clean UI, with appropriate coloring and symbols
- Best looking landing page and UI in my opinion
- the block explorer is here: https://mempool.space/blocks

**Cons**
- Not really a con... Focus is on mempool, not on blocks or price.
