Book is easy to follow for a  experienced python programmer, and provides a nice interactive way to learn concepts of Bitcoin technology through small exercises in python. 

Overall, I find this much more digestible than Andreas Ant's Mastering Bitcoin book. 

### Is it actually useful?
It is hard see how learning the highly technical concepts of Bitcoin useful for getting rich. After all, that is the primary reason we got into crypto. It is 2024 at the time of this writing, Bitcoin is about 15 years old, still a nascent speculative technology. Nobody is buying coffee with crypto yet, and as a developer, you have to have deep knowledge of the programming stack. I want to make money doing something cool with technology, but I don't know if learning the deep technical knowledge is the right way to go. However, part of me enjoys the learning process, and hopefully it makes me into a better programmer in the end.
